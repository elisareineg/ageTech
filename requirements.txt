# Optional: Advanced hyperparameter optimization 
# scikit-optimize>=0.9.0

# Note: SHAP is now required for model interpretability
# If SHAP installation fails, the pipeline will run with limited interpretability features

# Current Working Dependencies (as of latest pipeline run):
# - All core ML functionality works with scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
# - SHAP provides model interpretability
# - Pipeline achieves 80%+ performance with current dependencies
# - Optional dependencies (XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-optimize) are gracefully handled

# Additional dependencies used in the codebase
# pathlib is built-in for Python 3.4+ (no need to install separately)

# Optional: For advanced hyperparameter optimization (currently commented out)
# scikit-optimize>=0.9.0

# Optional: For advanced gradient boosting models (currently commented out)
# xgboost>=1.5.0
# lightgbm>=3.3.0
