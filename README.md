# AgeTech Adoption Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict AgeTech adoption success in real-world clinical populations of older adults. The model identifies key factors influencing technology adoption and provides insights for healthcare providers and policymakers.

## Research Questions

- **Primary**: Can a machine learning model accurately predict AgeTech adoption success in real-world clinical populations of older adults, and what factors most strongly influence these predictions?
- **Secondary**:
  - How does model performance vary across demographic and clinical subgroups?
  - What predictive factors emerge in real-world data not captured in synthetic datasets?
  - How do prediction accuracy rates compare between different AgeTech device categories?

## Dataset Structure

The synthetic dataset includes 500 individuals with 18 variables across four domains:

### Demographic Variables (3)

- Age group
- Socioeconomic status
- Living situation

### Health/Cognitive Variables (5)

- Cognitive status (No Impairment/MCI/Dementia)
- Physical mobility
- Hearing/vision impairment
- Chronic conditions
- Medication effects

### Social Support Variables (2)

- Caregiver support availability
- Social engagement level

### Technology Readiness Variables (8)

- Digital literacy
- Internet access
- Attitude toward technology
- Previous tech use
- AgeTech experience
- Tech assistance availability
- Willingness to use new technology
- Device preferences

### Outcome Variable

- Binary AgeTech adoption success

## Technical Implementation

- **Programming Environment**: Python with scikit-learn, XGBoost, NumPy, Pandas
- **Model Comparison**: Gradient Boosting (primary), Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- **Validation Framework**: 80-20 train-test split, 5-fold cross-validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC
- **Interpretability**: SHAP analysis for feature importance

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run data preprocessing: `python src/data/preprocess.py`
4. Train models: `python src/models/train.py`
5. Evaluate performance: `python src/models/evaluate.py`

## Ethical Considerations

- Fairness metrics across demographic subgroups
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Transparency in decision-making processes
- Equitable access to AgeTech recommendations

## Future Work

- Real-world validation study (Phase 2)
- Clinical decision support tool development
- Economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis
- Model expansion with additional predictive variables
